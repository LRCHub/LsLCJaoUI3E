[00:16.75] You come to me with
[00:19.18] Scars on your wrist.
[00:21.01] You tell me this will be the last night
[00:24.76] Feeling like this.
[00:27.55] I just came to say good bye
[00:30.73] Didn't want you to see me cry
[00:33.12] I'm fine
[00:35.33] But I know it's a lie
[00:38.00] This is the last night
[00:40.24] You'll spend alone
[00:41.74] Look me in the eyes
[00:43.06] So I know you know
[00:44.40] I'm everywhere
[00:47.09] You want me to be
[00:49.99] The last night
[00:51.46] You'll spend alone
[00:53.05] I'll wrap you in my arms
[00:54.39] And I won't let go
[00:55.78] I'm everything
[00:58.49] You need me to be
[01:07.56] Your parents say
[01:09.39] Everything is your fault
[01:11.70] But they don't know you like I know you
[01:15.08] They don't know you at all
[01:18.19] I'm so sick of when they say
[01:21.50] "Its just a phase you'll be ok
[01:23.90] You're fine"
[01:26.50] But I know it's a lie
[01:28.97] This is the last night
[01:31.07] You'll spend alone
[01:32.64] Look me in the eyes
[01:33.96] So I know you know
[01:35.32] I'm everywhere
[01:37.99] You want me to be
[01:52.31] (The last night
[01:54.32] Away from me)
[02:03.54] The night is so long when
[02:09.35] Everything's wrong
[02:11.79] If you give me your hand
[02:14.28] I will help you hold on
[02:17.56] Tonight
[02:23.13] Tonight
[02:30.61] This is the last night
[02:33.15] You'll spend alone
[02:34.71] Look me in the eyes
[02:36.03] So I know you know
[02:37.34] I'm everywhere
[02:39.99] You want me to be
[02:54.72] I won't let you say goodbye
[02:57.63] And I'll be your reason why
[03:05.57] The last night
[03:07.57] Away from me
[03:10.44] Away from me
